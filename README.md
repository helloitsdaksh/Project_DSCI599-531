### Overview
This submission contains all relevant materials for Project, focusing on the analysis of bias in job ad click prediction using the **Criteo/FairJob dataset**. It includes **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), experimental implementations, model training, and evaluation results**.

### Contents
1. **Code**  
   - Contains Python scripts for:
     - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Includes data distribution analysis, bias detection, Chi-square testing, and fairness metric computation. [EDA.ipynb]
     - **Experimentation and Model Training**: Implementation of Logistic Regression, Fair Logistic Regression, and XGBoost for fairness-aware job ad click prediction. [DSCI_531_599_Project.ipynb]

2. **Results**  
   - Contains **Results CSV**, capturing model evaluation metrics.  
   - **Experiments are still ongoing**, and additional results will be included in Project C.  
   - Current metrics available:
     - **Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL)**
     - **AUROC**
     - **Demographic Parity Score**
     - **Equal Opportunity Score**
     - **Utility Product Score**
